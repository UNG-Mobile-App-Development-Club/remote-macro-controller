# Remote Macro Controller System

A **remote custom macro/controller system** that enables users to control target devices (PC, smart TV, etc.) through a mobile or web application. The system consists of three main components:

- **Receiver:** A daemon running on a target device that executes commands such as opening applications, navigating the system, or managing system settings.  
- **Client:** A mobile or web app that allows users to interact with their receivers and configure macros.  
- **Server:** Manages communication between devices. Can be self-hosted or cloud-based, depending on the security model.  

## Features
- Execute custom macros on remote devices  
- Control applications, system settings, and navigation remotely  
- Cross-platform support for receivers (PC, smart TV, etc.)  
- Secure communication between client and receiver  
- Self-hosted or cloud-based deployment options  

## Tech Stack  
> The technology stack is **yet to be determined**. We are currently exploring the best options for backend, frontend, communication, and authentication.  

## Installation (To Be Updated)
Once the tech stack is finalized, installation steps for the server, receiver, and client will be provided.
